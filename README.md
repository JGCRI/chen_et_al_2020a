Global land use projections for 2015-2100 at 0.05-degree resolution under diverse Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways

## Abstract
Global future land use (LU) is an important input for Earth system models for projecting Earth system dynamics and is critical for many modeling studies on future global change. Here we generated a new global gridded LU dataset using an integrated human-Earth system model and a geospatial downscaling model under diverse Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios. Compared to existing similar datasets, the presented dataset has a higher spatial resolution (0.05°×0.05°) and spread under more diverse SSP-RCP scenarios (in total 15 scenarios), and considers uncertainties from the forcing climates. In addition, since we used a single integrated human-Earth system model, our LU dataset is more self-consistent. We compared our dataset with the Land Use Harmonization version 2 dataset and found that they generally show good agreement in their spatial distribution. The presented dataset will be useful for global Earth system modeling studies, especially for the analysis of the impacts of land use and land cover change and socioeconomics, as well as the uncertainties associated with these impacts.
